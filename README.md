# Pet Web project

The goal of this project is to have a single-page application that displays and lets you manage a list of animals.

Each animal is of a specific family (e.g. dog, cat ...), has a name (unique), an age, a diet and a noise. Diet and noise are specific to the
family. It is also important to note that each family is able to perform a special ability (e.g., jump, swim, ...).

The user can select what to display between the following lists:

1 - One displays the various families of animals (called the "global" list).

- This list should display the family name, the diet and the total number of individuals.
- It should be possible to add a new individual.
- A tooltip on the family name will display his noise.

2 - One displays the list of each individuals of a specific family (called the "specific" list)

- This list should display the name and the age of the different animals
- It should be possible to remove an individual.

This project is a static web page and can be executed directly from a browser pointing to a specific file, no need of persistence or
any server.

The document is structured in a way that can provide two different CSS files to modify the layout of the page.
